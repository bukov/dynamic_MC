# dynamic_MC

This is a python 2.7 code for the 'Car Mountain' problem, see Sutton and Barto, Chapter 11.

## Goals:
 * generalise the reinforcement learning state to contain time instead of velocity
 * generalise Q-learning algorithm to weighted importance sampling (follow one policy, learn another)
 * think of a better way to dodecent exploration
